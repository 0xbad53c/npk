      # v0.11, but is no longer supported in Terraform v0.12.
      #
      # If the expression in the following list itself returns a list, remove the
      # brackets to avoid interpretation as a list of lists. If the expression
      # returns a single list item then leave it as-is and remove this TODO comment.
